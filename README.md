# Neomorphism-Website

This is my original personal website. I wanted to create an online portfolio, and I was really intrigued by this new style called neomorphism. Neomorphism creates the appearance of 3 dimensional objects on a webpage. So instead of a website with elements appearing flat and generic, my website was intended to pop off the screen and draw in viewers.
